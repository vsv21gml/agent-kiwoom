# Short-Term Trading Strategy

## Core Rules
1. Focus on high-liquidity stocks in watchlist.
2. Default holding period target: intraday to 3 trading days.
3. Do not allocate over 25% of total asset to a single symbol.
4. Use staged entries (split buy in up to 2 tranches).
5. Cut loss at -2.5% from average buy price unless strong catalyst is detected.
6. Take profit in 2 stages: +2% (partial), +4% (additional).

## News-Aware Adjustments
1. If latest news is strongly negative, tighten stop-loss by 0.5%.
2. If multiple high-confidence positive catalysts exist, allow 1 extra holding day.

## Risk Controls
1. Keep at least 20% cash buffer.
2. Max new buy count per cycle: 2.
3. Skip trading during abnormal volatility spikes.

## Current Cycle Adjustments
- **Stop-Loss Adjustment**: The cautious market sentiment, as indicated by "US stock futures edge lower as tech recovery stalls; Fed minutes awaited," persists. This outlook continues to suggest potential for increased volatility and headwinds for the tech sector and broader market. This situation reinforces the need for a tighter risk control.
    *   Therefore, the stop-loss remains temporarily tightened by 0.5% (from the default -2.5%).
    *   **Effective stop-loss for current positions and new entries is -2.0% from average buy price.**
